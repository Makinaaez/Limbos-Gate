# Limbos-Gate
Indie game developed by one person, I created the art and the animations, as well as the code.  

the main files, such as the code and the art can be found in the assets folder

the folder called sprites contains copyrighted images that where used in the prototyping phase of the project, those are not being used in the game. The game sprites can be found in the new sprites folder
